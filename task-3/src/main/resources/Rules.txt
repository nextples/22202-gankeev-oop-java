1.  Objective: The objective of the game is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

2.  Setup: Each player arranges their ships secretly on a grid. The grid is typically 10x10 and each player
    has a fleet of ships, such as an aircraft carrier, battleship, cruiser, submarine, and destroyer.

3.  Gameplay: Players take turns calling out coordinates on the opponent's grid to try and hit their ships.
    For example, "A-3" or "B-7". The opponent responds with "Miss" if the coordinate doesn't hit a ship or "Hit"
    if it does.

4.  Hits and Misses: If a player hits a ship, the opponent marks that coordinate as a hit. If a player misses,
    the opponent marks it as a miss. The goal is to strategically guess where the opponent's ships are and sink
    them by hitting all the coordinates of a ship.

5.  Sinking Ships: When all the coordinates of a ship are hit, the ship is considered sunk. The player must
    announce which ship has been sunk.

6.  Winning the Game: The game continues until one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships. That player is
    declared the winner.
